# Missile-Command
V 0.0.1

About:
Missile Command VR is a remake of the classic 1980’s Missile Command arcade game by Atari. The player must defend their cities against incoming ballistic missiles by launching their own missile to intercept them.
This project was a prototype and the first of a portfolio of work made by a small indie development studio based out of Istanbul - Turkey. It represents the first step for the team into Virtual Reality and is a nod towards the pioneers of the early 1980s who were exploring the potentials and limitations of the video game technology at the time – a very similar story to Virtual Reality today.

How to Play:
Left Mouse Button to launch your missile
Mouse Mouse Button to Detonate
