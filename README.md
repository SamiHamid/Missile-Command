# Missile-Command V 0.0.1

#About

Missile Command VR is a remake of the classic 1980’s [Missile Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_Command) arcade game by Atari. The player must defend their cities against incoming ballistic missiles by launching their own missile to intercept them.

This project was a prototype and the first of a portfolio of work made by a small indie development studio based out of Istanbul - Turkey. It represents the first step for the team into Virtual Reality and is a nod towards the pioneers of the early 1980s who were exploring the potentials and limitations of the video game technology at the time – a very similar story to Virtual Reality today.

# How to Play
 
 - Aim for the incoming enemy missiles with your head
 - Launch your missile with Left Mouse Button 
 - Destroy enemy missiles with detonating your own missile with Right Mouse Button
